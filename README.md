# TI-83x

If Texas Instruments still made a TI-83... well it would probably look a lot a lot different than this, but this is about what I would want it to look like.

I'm completely replacing the internals of a TI-83 Plus graphing calculator and moderizing them.

This project is licenced under CERN-OHL-S v2.

## Featuring
