# TI-83x

![Render of the TI-83 PCB](/Pictures/render.png)

If Texas Instruments still made a TI-83... well, it would probably look a lot a lot different than this, but this is what I would want it to look like.

I'm completely replacing the internals of a TI-83 Plus graphing calculator and moderizing them.

This project is licenced under CERN-OHL-S v2.
